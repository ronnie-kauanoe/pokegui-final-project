# Pokemon GUI Final Project

A GUI made in Java that simulates the catching minigame and backpack storage system in the Pokemon games. This was the final project for my Introduction to Computer Science II (ICS 211) class.

Credit to Lisa Miller, my computer science professor at Kapiolani Community College, for providing the starter files for this project.
